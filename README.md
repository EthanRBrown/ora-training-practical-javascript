# Practical JavaScript

## Set-Up

Please follow these set-up instructions _before_ class starts; we have a lot of material to cover, and there's no time built into the schedule to help people get set up.

You have two options for set-up: a Cloud9 development environment (recommended for beginners or people new to JavaScript or command lines), or your own environment (for more experienced participants who have a command line and editor they like, and are familiar with Git).

### Set-Up with Cloud9 (Recommended for Beginners)

* Go to https://c9.io
* Sign in or sign up if you don’t already have an account
* Once you have logged in, click on "Create a new workspace"
* Give your workspace a name (example: “practical-javascript”)
* Choose "Node.js" template
* Press "Create workspace"
* In the terminal, `type nvm install 6`
* In the terminal, `type npm install -g yarn` (ignore deprecation warning)

### Set-Up with Your Own Environment (For Experienced Users)

If you're really comfortable with the command-line, Git, and have a favorite editor, you are welcome to follow along in your own environment.  See below for the things you'll need.
